# stock-tracker-python

This Python script tracks the stocks provided by the user and creates an Excel file with a table containing stock information.
The table includes the stock name, price, and percentage performance over the last 24 hours. Additionally, the user provides the
amount of each stock they own, and the script generates a graph showing the portfolio's worth over the last week.
